# Skin Type Classification Model

This repository contains a skin type classification model implemented using DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ResNet50, and Xception architectures. The model is trained to classify images into different skin types: Aging, Dry, Normal, Oily, and Sensitive.

## Skin Types and Characteristics

### Aging Skin
Characteristics: Fine lines, wrinkles, loss of elasticity, and possibly age spots.

### Dry Skin
Characteristics: Flakiness, rough texture, tightness, and dull appearance.

### Normal Skin
Characteristics: Balanced oil production, minimal sensitivity, and few imperfections.

### Oily Skin
Characteristics: Excess sebum production, enlarged pores, and a shiny complexion.

### Sensitive Skin
Characteristics: Prone to redness, irritation, itching, or burning sensations.
